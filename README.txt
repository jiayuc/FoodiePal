- Overview
FoodiePal is a website dedicated to offering students and visitors advice on food and services. By viewing ratings and reviews as well as giving their preferences, people will be able to find just the business that they are looking for. There is also an multiple people mode, where the website can return a lists of results which best suits a group of people who may have different taste.
- Usefulness
FoodiePal has a cutting-edge feature, where it can give you the best results of businesses when there are two sets of filters, each entered by one person. This solves the problem when you and your friend want to go out, and you either do not know your friendâ€™s preference or you do not know which restaurant to go to so that it agrees with all the conditions that you and your friend want it to have. Although our website is a lot alike to Yelp, as far as we are concerned, Yelp does not have that feature.

- Realness
Our data includes user request information and also general data about businesses. We will have forms in the page, where user can enter their preferences, and put in keywords. We will get the data about restaurants and services mainly from Yelp API.

 Restaurant recommendation for multiple users. 
       Our application can provide restaurant recommendation not only for one user, but for a group of two people also. One user can search for their friend they're eating out with by their ID number. Then our website will take into consideration of both users' profiles. We'll consider each different restaurant as a vector containing info such as price level or categories. By analyzing these vectors we'll come up with the a list of restaurants for the users to choose from. We plan to accomplish this by updating users' labels according to their view history. We'll build machine learning model in order to optimize our recommendations.
